This is a collection of modules to use with Puppet.

Some modules are really simple, other are more complicated and powerful,
these ones generally have a README file documentating their use.

All these modules are actually tested on Debian Squeeze but they may work on
other Debian versions, or other Puppet supported systems.

This modules are licensed under the BSD License, see the LICENSE file.

Main source code and project management (issues) website is on bitbucket at
    http://bitbucket.org/daks/puppet-modules

but if your prefer git over hg, the code is mirrored at 
    http://github.com/daks/puppet-modules
